There were also concerns in certain quarters that PEPs were finding it difficult to get loans or open bank accounts.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nIn the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as “individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials”. The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.\\r\\nBank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official. A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank.\\r\\nThe central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.\\r\\nLast year, the Centre amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce more disclosures for non-government organisations by reporting entities.</td>\n",

The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.\\r\\nBank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official. A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank.\\r\\nThe central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.\\r\\nLast year, the Centre amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce more disclosures for non-government organisations by reporting entities.   \n",

The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.\\r\\nOthers taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).\\r\\nCheck out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list\\r\\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nHow can I watch the Golden Globes?\\r\\nViewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.\\r\\nJust 3️⃣ MORE DAYS until we are LIVE from the 📍 @beverlyhilton for the 81st Annual #GoldenGlobes!\\r\\nTune in SUNDAY on @CBS and @paramountplus at 8pm ET/5pm PT pic.twitter.com/SOGznSb9Mt\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat’s new with the Golden Globes?\\r\\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.\\r\\nWho’s hosting the Globes?\\r\\nComedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.\\r\\nThe #GoldenGlobes festivities have popped off with @moetchandon! 🍾\\r\\nTune in THIS Sunday at 8pm ET | 5pm PT on @CBS and stream on @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/T6mYHrW4Ps\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat about 60 Minutes?\\r\\nThe Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.\\r\\nGolden Globe nominees\\r\\nBarbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu’s The Bear.\\r\\nDon't Miss | Barbie and Succession lead 2024 Golden Globe nominations, Oppenheimer scores 8 nods\\r\\nWhat are the Globes known for?\\r\\nThe Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.\\r\\n#GoldenGlobes host, @Jokoy, has been getting ALL the advice! Tune in to the show THIS SUNDAY, Jan 7 @ 8 ET | 5 PT on @CBS and @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/3Y9TshVBMC\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nSome years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nWho votes on the Globes?\\r\\nThe group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.\\r\\nClick for more updates and latest Hollywood News along with Bollywood and Entertainment updates.

Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.\\r\\nIn a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”\\r\\nMust Read | Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI\\r\\n“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.\\r\\nReuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nHindenburg saga, regulatory probe \\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.\\r\\nIndia’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.\\r\\nLast week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.\\r\\nExplained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far\\r\\nThe media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”\\r\\n“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.\\r\\nExpress Investigation | Exposed &amp; shut, Panama Papers law firm outsourced its offshore deals to Kerala accountant; ED probe on\\r\\nIf so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.\\r\\nIn an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock.

       "2  Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfried will be among the presenters at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards. The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.\\r\\nOthers taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).\\r\\nCheck out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list\\r\\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nHow can I watch the Golden Globes?\\r\\nViewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.\\r\\nJust 3️⃣ MORE DAYS until we are LIVE from the 📍 @beverlyhilton for the 81st Annual #GoldenGlobes!\\r\\nTune in SUNDAY on @CBS and @paramountplus at 8pm ET/5pm PT pic.twitter.com/SOGznSb9Mt\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat’s new with the Golden Globes?\\r\\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.\\r\\nWho’s hosting the Globes?\\r\\nComedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.\\r\\nThe #GoldenGlobes festivities have popped off with @moetchandon! 🍾\\r\\nTune in THIS Sunday at 8pm ET | 5pm PT on @CBS and stream on @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/T6mYHrW4Ps\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat about 60 Minutes?\\r\\nThe Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.\\r\\nGolden Globe nominees\\r\\nBarbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things.

The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.\\r\\n#GoldenGlobes host, @Jokoy, has been getting ALL the advice! Tune in to the show THIS SUNDAY, Jan 7 @ 8 ET | 5 PT on @CBS and @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/3Y9TshVBMC\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nSome years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nWho votes on the Globes?\\r\\nThe group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.\\r\\nClick for more updates and latest Hollywood News along with Bollywood and Entertainment updates.

OnePlus Nord 3 5G, we praised its balanced combination of features and price, noting it was a “great choice for those who want a perfectly-balanced phone.” However, we also concluded that the pricing was a wee bit high for this product tier, likely a result of the OnePlus brand cachet.\\r\\nWell, a fresh discount has now made this already-appealing phone even more compelling, bringing it below the Rs 30,000 threshold that many buyers psychologically key on.\\r\\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\\r\\nRegister to read more stories\\r\\nContinue

Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.\\r\\nIn a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”\\r\\nMust Read | Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI\\r\\n“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.\\r\\nReuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nHindenburg saga, regulatory probe \\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.\\r\\nIndia’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.\\r\\nLast week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.\\r\\nExplained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far\\r\\nThe media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”\\r\\n“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.\\r\\nExpress Investigation | Exposed & shut, Panama Papers law firm outsourced its offshore deals to Kerala accountant; ED probe on\\r\\nIf so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.\\r\\nIn an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, “We are a simple business.”   \n",

The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.\\r\\nOthers taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).\\r\\nCheck out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list\\r\\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nHow can I watch the Golden Globes?\\r\\nViewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.\\r\\nJust 3️⃣ MORE DAYS until we are LIVE from the 📍 @beverlyhilton for the 81st Annual #GoldenGlobes!\\r\\nTune in SUNDAY on @CBS and @paramountplus at 8pm ET/5pm PT pic.twitter.com/SOGznSb9Mt\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat’s new with the Golden Globes?\\r\\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.\\r\\nWho’s hosting the Globes?\\r\\nComedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.\\r\\nThe #GoldenGlobes festivities have popped off with @moetchandon! 🍾\\r\\nTune in THIS Sunday at 8pm ET | 5pm PT on @CBS and stream on @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/T6mYHrW4Ps\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat about 60 Minutes?\\r\\nThe Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.\\r\\nGolden Globe nominees\\r\\nBarbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu’s The Bear.\\r\\nDon't Miss | Barbie and Succession lead 2024 Golden Globe nominations, Oppenheimer scores 8 nods\\r\\nWhat are the Globes known for?\\r\\nThe Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.\\r\\n#GoldenGlobes host, @Jokoy, has been getting ALL the advice! Tune in to the show THIS SUNDAY, Jan 7 @ 8 ET | 5 PT on @CBS and @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/3Y9TshVBMC\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nSome years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nWho votes on the Globes?\\r\\nThe group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.\\r\\nClick for more updates and latest Hollywood News along with Bollywood and Entertainment updates.

       "      <td>Millions of dollars were invested in some publicly traded stocks of India’s Adani Group via “opaque” Mauritius funds that “obscured” involvement of alleged business partners of the Adani family, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) said in an article on Thursday.\\r\\nCiting review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.\\r\\nThe OCCRP article comes after U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January accused Adani Group of improper business dealings, including the use of offshore entities in tax havens such as Mauritius from where it said certain offshore funds “surreptitiously” owned stock in Adani’s listed firms.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nAdani Group has called Hindenburg’s claims misleading and without evidence and said it always complied with laws. Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.\\r\\nIn a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”\\r\\nMust Read | Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI\\r\\n“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.\\r\\nReuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nHindenburg saga, regulatory probe \\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.\\r\\nIndia’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.\\r\\nLast week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.\\r\\nExplained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far\\r\\nThe media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”\\r\\n“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.\\r\\nExpress Investigation | Exposed &amp; shut, Panama Papers law firm outsourced its offshore deals to Kerala accountant; ED probe on\\r\\nIf so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.\\r\\nIn an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, “We are a simple business.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just after Rohit Sharma clumped Nathan Lyon over mid-wicket, the off-spinner stared suspiciously at the surface. The pitch might have stared back inexpressively at him. Lyon had beaten him three balls ago, some balls before that were scudding low as well, but the 22-yard patch of intrigue and interest seemed to be more benign when Sharma rampaged to an unbeaten 56 off 69 balls, taking India to 77/1 at stumps, exactly a century of runs behind Australia’s total.\\r\\nPerhaps, this was a case of batsman’s skills providing the pitch a harmless makeover. Perhaps, Australia’s batsmen made it look harder than it actually was. Perhaps, Sharma’s cavalier approach was the way to bat on this low-bounce, slow-turning deck. Maybe, Australia were a fraction overcautious in phases in the first session. Maybe, India’s spinners simply bowled better, tighter and sharper, though without any doubt this was a challenging surface to bat.\\r\\nYou need a subscription to read this archive article.\\r\\nBUY NOW\\r\\nAlready a subscriber?

       "2  Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfried will be among the presenters at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards. The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.\\r\\nOthers taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).\\r\\nCheck out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list\\r\\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nHow can I watch the Golden Globes?\\r\\nViewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.\\r\\nJust 3️⃣ MORE DAYS until we are LIVE from the 📍 @beverlyhilton for the 81st Annual #GoldenGlobes!\\r\\nTune in SUNDAY on @CBS and @paramountplus at 8pm ET/5pm PT pic.twitter.com/SOGznSb9Mt\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat’s new with the Golden Globes?\\r\\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.\\r\\nWho’s hosting the Globes?\\r\\nComedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.\\r\\nThe #GoldenGlobes festivities have popped off with @moetchandon! 🍾\\r\\nTune in THIS Sunday at 8pm ET | 5pm PT on @CBS and stream on @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/T6mYHrW4Ps\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nWhat about 60 Minutes?\\r\\nThe Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.\\r\\nGolden Globe nominees\\r\\nBarbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu’s The Bear.\\r\\nDon't Miss | Barbie and Succession lead 2024 Golden Globe nominations, Oppenheimer scores 8 nods\\r\\nWhat are the Globes known for?\\r\\nThe Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.\\r\\n#GoldenGlobes host, @Jokoy, has been getting ALL the advice! Tune in to the show THIS SUNDAY, Jan 7 @ 8 ET | 5 PT on @CBS and @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/3Y9TshVBMC\\r\\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\\r\\nSome years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nWho votes on the Globes?\\r\\nThe group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.\\r\\nClick for more updates and latest Hollywood News along with Bollywood and Entertainment updates.

OnePlus Nord 3 5G, we praised its balanced combination of features and price, noting it was a “great choice for those who want a perfectly-balanced phone.” However, we also concluded that the pricing was a wee bit high for this product tier, likely a result of the OnePlus brand cachet.\\r\\nWell, a fresh discount has now made this already-appealing phone even more compelling, bringing it below the Rs 30,000 threshold that many buyers psychologically key on.\\r\\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\\r\\nRegister to read more stories\\r\\nContinue

Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.\\r\\nIn a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”\\r\\nMust Read | Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI\\r\\n“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.\\r\\nReuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nHindenburg saga, regulatory probe \\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.\\r\\nIndia’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.\\r\\nLast week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.\\r\\nExplained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far\\r\\nThe media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”\\r\\n“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.\\r\\nExpress Investigation | Exposed & shut, Panama Papers law firm outsourced its offshore deals to Kerala accountant; ED probe on\\r\\nIf so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.\\r\\nIn an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, “We are a simple business.”   \n",

      Just after Rohit Sharma clumped Nathan Lyon over mid-wicket, the off-spinner stared suspiciously at the surface. The pitch might have stared back inexpressively at him. Lyon had beaten him three balls ago, some balls before that were scudding low as well, but the 22-yard patch of intrigue and interest seemed to be more benign when Sharma rampaged to an unbeaten 56 off 69 balls, taking India to 77/1 at stumps, exactly a century of runs behind Australia’s total.\\r\\nPerhaps, this was a case of batsman’s skills providing the pitch a harmless makeover. Perhaps, Australia’s batsmen made it look harder than it actually was. Perhaps, Sharma’s cavalier approach was the way to bat on this low-bounce, slow-turning deck. Maybe, Australia were a fraction overcautious in phases in the first session. Maybe, India’s spinners simply bowled better, tighter and sharper, though without any doubt this was a challenging surface to bat.\\r\\nYou need a subscription to read this archive article.\\r\\nBUY NOW\\r\\nAlready a subscriber?

                             Shah Rukh Khan has been in the movies for 30 years now but before that, the actor started his journey from the world of television. SRK worked in TV shows like Fauji, Circus among many others and soon became an actor to watch out for. In a recent conversation with Mukesh Khanna, veteran actor Aanjjan Srivastav shared that Shah Rukh was an “inquisitive” actor even in those early days.\\r\\nAanjjan recalled the time when Shah Rukh would frequently collaborate with Aziz Mirza and Kundan Shah, and recalled that before he became a movie actor, he was offered a small role in the TV show Wagle Ki Duniya. The Doordarshan show was extremely popular at the time and made Aanjjan a household name. He recalled, “He was offered a small role in Wagle Ki Duniya. He jumped on the offer and said I’ll do it, just tell me what to do.” Aanjjan recalled that he initially wanted another actor for the part but when he worked with SRK, he was in awe of his talent. “He was not a star at the time and he had such sportsman spirit,” he said.\\r\\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.
